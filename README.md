# Starter template for projects

Includes Vite, React, react-router-dom, styled-components, tailwind, daisyui, pocketbase, and some minor optimizations that I often use for beginning a new project. 

To use,
- git clone https://github.com/asyncawaitpromise/starter.git .
- git remote remove origin
- pnpm i
- pnpm host

And you're ready to start working with it!

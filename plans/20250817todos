Mobile multiselect works how? 
pc drag to drop new item doesn't work (tried to drag element maybe event.preventDefault)
Need to consider a details panel that can expand / collapse from side
- Panel has options to change visuals (color, edge shape)
- Notes about specific object
- Title which shows up on display
- Panel shows up for connections as well

Maybe a bar feature to drop a bar or other node-connection object
- Allows for organizing relationships in a more coherant way
